## Description

"Seven figures, for Wordle?!" I couldn't believe what I was reading. New York Times had really paid "in the low" seven figures. I had two thoughts, simultaneously. First - a million is a million, low or not. And more importantly - I could make that! So I decided to put my money where my mouth was and try and make a wordle type app. I am slowly going to incorporate and limit the dictionary to "Colorado-themed lingo", but for now it run on the same rules and dictionary as the wordle app. Really, the only thing that makes it Colorado themed in it's current state is the color scheme, all taken directly from the Colorado flag.
